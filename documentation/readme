To change the map being used, look in search.jsp: 
	String whichMap = "Herculaneum";


Setup and Running:
	To run the project, you can either use the keyword search or the map search.
	The keyword search consists of a dropdown select box, indicating different regions
	you can search on. You can choose a region there first, then a new select box appears
	and you can choose a more specific region in the new select box. This part is 
	implemented using javascript. The addSelect function makes sure that a new box is 
	added.
	There are several libraries needed to run our project which are postsql, jquery,
	imagemapster (needs jquery to run). Also to setup the project to run properly
	one must first set the directory address of the region2mapID file correctly in
	the mapServlet.java file in the Java Resources/src/servlets. Other than that
	most of the application is pretty user friendly and one can navigate through
	the mapsearch by clicking on different regions.
Data:
	Currently the the application uses a local database called hopper and users
	 cannot write to the database. In the future we will link the application
	 directly to the EAGLE database and get our results from there.
