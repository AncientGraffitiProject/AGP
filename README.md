The Ancient Graffiti Project provides a search engine for locating and studying graffiti of the early Roman empire from the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.

You can learn more about the project at [ancientgraffiti.wlu.edu](ancientgraffiti.wlu.edu), and the current public prototype is available at [agp.wlu.edu](agp.wlu.edu).
